<h1>How to Configure Roles and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) on osTicket</h1>

<h3>- Admin Panel vs Agent Panel</h3>

osTicket has both an 'Admin' Panel and an 'Agent' Panel.  
The Admin Panel allows an admin user to set up the ticketing system, define roles and SLAs and perform other administrative functions in the osTicket environment.  
While the Agent Panel allows an agent user to work and close tickets opened by clients.


<h3>- What are Roles?</h3>

Roles are permissions that can be granted to Agents according to the departments to which they belong. Each Role comes with a set of permissions that can be enabled/disabled based on the user's Department. Examples of role permissions include:  
1. Assign (user can assign tickets to agents)
2. Close (user can close tickets)
3. Edit (user can edit tickets)
4. Delete (user can delete tickets) etc.
